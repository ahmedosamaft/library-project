        <p>
          Join Harry Potter on the magical journey of a lifetime in the fourth book in J.K. Rowling's multi-award-winning series. The Triwizard
          Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that
          he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of
          those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron
          and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive! J.K. Rowling's internationally bestselling Harry Potter books continue to captivate new
          generations of readers. Harry's fourth adventure invites you to explore even more of the wizarding world; from the foggy, frozen depths of
          the Great Lake to the silvery secrets of the Pensieve. This gorgeous paperback edition features a spectacular cover by award-winning artist
          Jonny Duddle, plus refreshed bonus material, allowing readers to learn more about the different breeds of dragon. Perfect for anyone who's
          ready to lose themselves in the biggest children's books of all time. CURSES - COURAGE - COMPETITION Seven magical stories, one epic
          adventure.
