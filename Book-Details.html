    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Join Harry Potter on the magical journey of a lifetime in the fourth book
      in J.K. Rowling's multi-award-winning series. The Triwizard Tournament is
      to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to
      enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the
      competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its
      selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the
      magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark
      wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might
      just make it through - alive! J.K. Rowling's internationally bestselling
      Harry Potter books continue to captivate new generations of readers.
      Harry's fourth adventure invites you to explore even more of the wizarding
      world; from the foggy, frozen depths of the Great Lake to the silvery
      secrets of the Pensieve. This gorgeous paperback edition features a
      spectacular cover by award-winning artist Jonny Duddle, plus refreshed
      bonus material, allowing readers to learn more about the different breeds
      of dragon. Perfect for anyone who's ready to lose themselves in the
      biggest children's books of all time. CURSES - COURAGE - COMPETITION Seven
      magical stories, one epic adventure.
